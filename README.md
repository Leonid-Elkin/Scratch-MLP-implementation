This is the neural network implemented entierly with low level libraries such as NumPy and plt that I am doing for my extended project qualification. I am using it to investigate neural scaling laws.
For example the hyperparameterChanges function in the Main program is able to plot graphs to display how each change of a hyperparameter affects accuracy. Another thing I measure is the computer efficiency frontier.

This is very much a work in progress so far so some things here may not work/make much sense

18/01/2025 - Achieved a 98.51 percent accuracy on MNIST. This is better than most of the other implementations I've seen

08/03/2025 - This is pretty much the finished product. I am not sure if I can improve this any more.

23/03/2025 - MLP now officially a library on PYPI. 
23/03/2025 - Adding two sibling repositories both using newly created library. One is a drawable grid for live handwritten digit classification demonstration, and the other is instructions of how to use.
