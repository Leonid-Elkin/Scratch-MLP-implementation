This is the neural network implemented entierly with low level libraries such as NumPy and plt that I am doing for my extended project qualification. I am using it to investigate neural scaling laws.
For example the hyperparameterChanges function in the Main program is able to plot graphs to display how each change of a hyperparameter affects accuracy. Another thing I measure is the computer efficiency frontier.

This is very much a work in progress so far so some things here may not work/make much sense
